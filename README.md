**## Overview**

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.

This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.



**## Summary**

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing) deals with direct marketing campaigns of a bank. This is a classification problem to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. 

The best model to predict this outcome has been identified using AutoML (as supposed to hyperparameter tuning of the given Scikit-learn Logisticregression script in train.py) with an accuracy of 91.7% (VotingEnsemble) as shown below:

**## Scikit-learn Pipeline**

***\*Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.\****



***\*What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?\****



***\*What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?\****



**## AutoML**

***\*In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.\****



**## Pipeline comparison**

***\*Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?\****



**## Future work**

***\*What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?\****



**## Proof of cluster clean up**
